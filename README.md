## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the correlation between aggression and overall rating among football players, specifically looking at the top male and female players. By investigating this relationship, we aim to gain insights into the role of aggression in football.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is the "EA SPORTS FC 24 Full Players Database and Stats." It is a comprehensive dataset containing information about football players. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nyagami/web-scraping-fc-24-players-stats-from-easports-com).

## Correlation Analysis

### Male Players

We started by exploring the correlation between aggression and overall rating among the top male players (N=14). The analysis revealed a negative correlation (-0.3369), suggesting that as aggression increases, the overall rating tends to decrease for male players.

### Female Players

For female players (N=14), the correlation was positive (0.7946), indicating that higher aggression is associated with higher overall rating.

## Most Aggressive Players

We identified the most aggressive players by position in both male and female categories.

### Male Players
- Klaus Gjasula (CDM) with Aggression: 95
- Pablo PÃ©rez (CM) with Aggression: 95

### Female Players
- Katie McCabe (LB) with Aggression: 94
- Hawa Cissoko (CB) with Aggression: 93

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed differing correlations between aggression and overall performance for male and female football players. This information may provide insights into player evaluation and strategy.
